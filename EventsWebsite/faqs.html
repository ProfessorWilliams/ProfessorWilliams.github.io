                   <p class="links">
                     Based on organization TCODEs you are granted the following permissions: <br>
                     1. <b>Full-Access:</b> You are assigned a Host TCODE matching primary, secondary or tertiary permission slots of the event. If you have full-access you will also need the Manage Published Events permission for TM1 Events.<br />
                     2. <b>Request-Only Access:</b> You are assigned a national TCODE matching slots 5-20 of the event. This also applies to Host TCODEs in any slot (1-3, 5-20) if you don’t have the Manage Published Events permission. Additionally, collaborators are granted request-only access.<br>
                     3. <b>No Access:</b> If your TCODEs do not match any slots on the event, you cannot see the event. Event access is determined only by the TCODEs that all the users in your organization are assigned.

After the published event passes the quality checks, which usually occurs within a minimum of five (5) business days, the ISM will be published.
